U-NET ARCHITECTURE – STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

------------------------------------------------
INPUT
------------------------------------------------
- Input size: 256 x 256 x 3
- Format: Normalized RGB image
- Source: Images taken from the CARLA simulator (dataA folder of the Lyft Udacity dataset)

------------------------------------------------
ENCODER (DOWN SAMPLING)
------------------------------------------------
Block 1:
  - Two 3x3 Conv2D layers with 32 filters each
  - Each followed by BatchNorm and ReLU activation
  - 2x2 MaxPooling to reduce spatial size
  - Output saved for skip connection

Block 2:
  - Same structure as above, but with 64 filters
  - Followed by MaxPooling and skip connection

Block 3:
  - Same as above with 128 filters
  - Followed by MaxPooling and skip connection

Block 4 (Bottleneck):
  - Two Conv2D layers with 256 filters
  - No pooling here
  - Acts as the deepest layer in the network

------------------------------------------------
DECODER (UP SAMPLING)
------------------------------------------------
Block 5:
  - Transposed Conv2D (stride 2) to upsample
  - Cropped to align with encoder output
  - Concatenated with encoder’s skip connection (Block 3)
  - Followed by two Conv2D layers with 256 filters

Block 6:
  - Transposed Conv2D (stride 2), concat with Block 2’s output
  - Two Conv2D layers with 128 filters

Block 7:
  - Transposed Conv2D (stride 2), concat with Block 1’s output
  - Two Conv2D layers with 64 filters

Block 8:
  - Final upsampling and refinement with two Conv2D layers using 32 filters

------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT LAYER
------------------------------------------------
- 1x1 Conv2D layer with 13 filters (number of classes)
- Activation: Sigmoid
- Output shape: 256 x 256 x 13 (pixel-wise predictions for each class)

------------------------------------------------
TOTAL CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS USED: 23
------------------------------------------------
