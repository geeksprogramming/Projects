Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ouaillaamiri02/furniture-and-essentials-image-dataset-5-classes/data

Note:
This project only uses a subset of the full dataset.

Classes Selected for Image-Based Lifestyle Modeling:
- 'laptop'  → Represents high-tech lifestyle
- 'chair'   → Represents mid-tech/urban average
- 'book'    → Represents low-tech/basic lifestyle

These categories are treated as proxies for economic lifestyle tiers and are used
to simulate the "vision_category" in our combined economic-visual forecasting system.

Two other categories in the original dataset are ignored.
